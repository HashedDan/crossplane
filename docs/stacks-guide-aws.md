## Introduction

In this guide we are focusing on WordPress stack, and will show how it could be
deployed using AWS resources. WordPress stack uses a generic Kubernetes cluster
and a MySQL database as its resource, which are not tied to a specific provider
(also known as **resource claims**). Instead, these resource claims could be
configured to use a be satisfied by a specific cloud provider.

We will walk you through installing the AWS stack, configuring an aws account,
and setting up cloud-specific resources in order to create and configure a
network configuration in which these cloud resources can communicate with each
other. Once the network configuration is done, we will specify a resource class
for each resource claim type. Then we will install WordPress stack, which will
create related external resources for each claim in AWS.

## Before you begin

Before continuing in this guide, make sure that all the following are true:

- Crossplane is installed
- [crossplane-cli] is installed
- `kubectl` is configured to target the Crossplane cluster
- An aws account is available

## Install AWS stack

Once Crossplane is installed, it can be extended to support AWS by installing
AWS **stack**.

The namespace where we install the stack, is also the one that our managed AWS
resources will reside. Let's call this namespace `infra-aws`, and go ahead and
create it:

```bash
# the namespace that the aws infra structure resources will be created
INFRA_NAMESPACE=infra-aws
# create the namespace in Crossplane
kubectl create namespace ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
```

The output will look like the following:

```bash
namespace/infra-aws created
```

Now we can create the AWS stack by using Crossplane CLI.  Since this is an
infrastructure stack, we need to specify that it's cluster-scoped via
`--cluster` flag.

```bash
kubectl crossplane stack generate-install --cluster 'crossplane/stack-aws:master' stack-aws | kubectl apply --namespace ${INFRA_NAMESPACE} -f -
```

The next steps assume that you installed the AWS stack into the `infra-aws`
namespace.

## Configure the AWS account

An [aws user] with `Administrative` privileges is needed to enable Crossplane to
create the required resources. Once the user is provisioned, an [Access Key]
needs to be created to enable the user to have API access. Next, using these set
of access key credentials, one needs to have [`aws` command line tool]
[installed] and [configured]. Then, the credentials and configuration will
reside in `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` respectively, which will be
consumed in the next step.

When configuring aws CLI, it is recommended that the user credentials are
configured under a specific [aws named profile] other than `default`. In this
guide we are assuming that the credentials are configured under
`crossplane-user` profile, but you can use other profiles as well. Let's store
the profile name in `aws_profile` variable to use later:

```bash
aws_profile=crossplane-user
```

## Configure Crossplane Provider for AWS

Crossplane uses the aws user credentials that was configured in the previous
step, to create resources in AWS. These credentials will be stored as a
[secret], and is managed them by an  [`aws provider`] instance. In addition to
the credentials, the AWS region is also read from the configuration to target a
specific region.

To store the credentials as a secret, run:

```bash
# retrieve profile's credentials, save it under 'default' profile, and base64 encode it
AWS_CREDS_BASE64=$(cat ${HOME}/.aws/credentials | awk '/["$aws_profile"]/ {getline; print $0}' | awk 'NR==1{print "[default]"}1' | base64 | tr -d "\n")

# retrieve the profile's region from config
AWS_REGION=$(awk '/["$aws_profile"]/ {getline; print $3}' ${HOME}/.aws/config)
```

At this point, the region and the encoded credentials are stored in respective
 variables. Next, we'll need to create an instance of [`aws provider`]:

```bash
cat > provider.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
  credentials: ${AWS_CREDS_BASE64}
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aws-user-creds
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
type: Opaque
---
apiVersion: aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: aws-provider
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  credentialsSecretRef:
    key: credentials
    name: aws-user-creds
  region: ${AWS_REGION}
EOF

# apply it to the cluster:
kubectl apply -f "provider.yaml"
```

The output will look like the following:

```bash
secret/aws-user-creds created
provider.aws.crossplane.io/aws-provider created
```

## Set Up Network Configuration

When configured in AWS, WordPress resources map to an EKS cluster and an RDS
database. In order to make the RDS instance accessible from the EKS cluster,
they both need to live within the same VPC. However VPC is not the only AWS
resource that needs to be created to enable inter-resource connectivity. In
general, a **Network Configuration**, which is built of a set of VPCs, Subnets,
Security Groups, Route Tables, IAM Roles and other resources, is required for
this purpose. For more information, see [AWS resource connectivity] design
document.

In this section we will build a simple network configuration, by creating AWS
resources that are managed by Crossplane. There are a couple of challenges when
creating these resources:

- Some of these resources depend on other ones. For instance, a Subnet is
  dependent on a VPC, so creating a Subnet needs to be done after creating the
  VPC.

  To solve this issue, we will need to create the resoruces in order, so the
  depependent resources are provisioned after creating their dependencies. Since
  provisioning a resource might take some time, we need to make sure the
  resource is ready, before moving forward to the next step. Let's create the
  following function for this purpose:

  ```bash
  # apply_and_wait_until_ready accepts the yaml file name as an argument
  # and then applies the yaml object. Then waits until the resource status
  # becomes Ready, which indicates that the resource is provisioned and
  # ready to be used
  function apply_and_wait_until_ready {
    kubectl apply -f "$1"
    kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready -f "$1"
  }
  ```

- Some of these resources have identifying attributes that are
  non-deterministic. In other words, they become known after the resource is
  provisioined. For instance, a VPC has a ID (VPC_ID) attribute which is
  consumed by other resources (like a Subnet), and only becomes known after the
  VPC is created.

  To tackle this challege, we will need to retrieve the non-deterministic
  identifiers of the resources after their creation, and inject them to the
  dependent resources that require those attribute.

The rest of this section creates the resources for a configuration described in
[the EKS user
guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-public-private-vpc.html).
For grouping all these resources together we will use a `CONFIG_NAME` variable,
which will be prepended to the names of these resources in Crossplane, and their
corresponding external resources in AWS. Keep in mind that if you create
multiple such configuration in the same Crossplane cluster or the same AWS
account, you will need to use different config names, otherwise there will be
naming conflicts.

```bash
# the name of the aws network configuration
CONFIG_NAME=aws-network-config
```

### VPC

A [Virtual Private Network] or VPC is a virtual network in AWS.

```bash
# build vpc yaml
cat > vpc.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: VPC
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-vpc
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  cidrBlock: 192.168.0.0/16
  enableDnsSupport: true
  enableDnsHostNames: true
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create a vpc object in Crossplane, and wait until the corresponding
# VPC in AWS is created and is Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "vpc.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
vpc.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-vpc created
vpc.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-vpc condition met
```

Once the VPC is created, you can see the full object and its status by running

```bash
kubectl get -f "vpc.yaml" -o yaml
```

The output will look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: VPC
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2","kind":"VPC","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"aws-network-config-vpc","namespace":"aws"},"spec":{"cidrBlock":"192.168.0.0/16","enableDnsHostNames":true,"enableDnsSupport":true,"providerRef":{"name":"aws-provider","namespace":"infra-aws"},"reclaimPolicy":"Delete"}}
  creationTimestamp: "2019-09-17T04:40:18Z"
  finalizers:
  - finalizer.managedresource.crossplane.io
  generation: 2
  name: aws-network-config-vpc
  namespace: aws
  resourceVersion: "92185"
  selfLink: /apis/network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2/namespaces/aws/vpcs/aws-network-config-vpc
  uid: 052e1934-00e4-43fb-adf8-5a93c45af363
spec:
  cidrBlock: 192.168.0.0/16
  enableDnsHostNames: true
  enableDnsSupport: true
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  writeConnectionSecretToRef: {}
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2019-09-17T04:43:24Z"
    reason: Managed resource is available for use
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  - lastTransitionTime: "2019-09-17T04:43:23Z"
    reason: Successfully reconciled managed resource
    status: "True"
    type: Synced
  vpcId: vpc-0661625a89f410b37
  vpcState: available
```

Now, we can retrieve the VPCID to use in subsequent resources:

```bash
VPC_ID=$(kubectl get -f "vpc.yaml"  -o jsonpath='{.status.vpcId}')
```

### Subnets

In this configuration we create three public [Subnet]s.

```bash
# build subnet yaml
cat > subnets.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-subnet1
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  cidrBlock: 192.168.64.0/18
  vpcId: ${VPC_ID}
  availabilityZone: ${AWS_REGION}a
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
---
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-subnet2
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  cidrBlock: 192.168.128.0/18
  vpcId: ${VPC_ID}
  availabilityZone: ${AWS_REGION}b
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
---
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-subnet3
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  cidrBlock: 192.168.192.0/18
  vpcId: ${VPC_ID}
  availabilityZone: ${AWS_REGION}c
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create subnet objects in Crossplane, and wait until the corresponding
# Subnets in AWS are created and Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "subnets.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
subnet.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-subnet1 created
subnet.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-subnet2 created
subnet.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-subnet3 created
subnet.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-subnet1 condition met
subnet.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-subnet2 condition met
subnet.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-subnet3 condition met
```

We need to retrieve the SubndtIDs for subsequent resources:

```bash
SUBNET1_ID=$(kubectl get -f "subnets.yaml" -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].status.subnetId}')
SUBNET2_ID=$(kubectl get -f "subnets.yaml" -o=jsonpath='{.items[1].status.subnetId}')
SUBNET3_ID=$(kubectl get -f "subnets.yaml" -o=jsonpath='{.items[2].status.subnetId}')
```

### Internet Gateway

An [Internet Gateway] enables the resources in the VPC to have access to the
Internet. Since the WordPress application will be addressed from the internet,
this resource is required in the network configuration.

```bash
# build internet gateway yaml
cat > internetgateway.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: InternetGateway
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-internetgateway
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  vpcId: ${VPC_ID}
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create subnet objects in Crossplane, and wait until the corresponding
# Subnets in AWS are created and Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "internetgateway.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
internetgateway.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-internetgateway created
internetgateway.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-internetgateway condition met
```

To retrieve the internete gateway ID (IG_ID):

```bash
IG_ID=$(kubectl get -f "internetgateway.yaml" -o=jsonpath='{.status.internetGatewayId}')
```

### Route Table

A [Route Table] sets rules to direct traffic in a virtual network. We use a
Route Table to redirect internet traffic from all Subnets to the Internet
Gateway instance that we created in previous step.

```bash
# build route table yaml
cat > routetable.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: RouteTable
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-routetable
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  vpcId: ${VPC_ID}
  routes:
    - destinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
      gatewayId: ${IG_ID}
  associations:
    - subnetId: ${SUBNET1_ID}
    - subnetId: ${SUBNET2_ID}
    - subnetId: ${SUBNET3_ID}
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create a routetable object in Crossplane, and wait until the corresponding
# Route Table in AWS is created and Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "routetable.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
routetable.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-routetable created
routetable.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-routetable condition met
```

### Cluster Security Group

A [Security Group] is created to later to be assigned to the EKS cluster. This
security group enables the cluster to communicate with the worker nodes

```bash
# build the cluster security group yaml
cat > cluster_sg.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: SecurityGroup
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-cluster-sg
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  vpcId: ${VPC_ID}
  groupName: ${CONFIG_NAME}-cluster-sg
  description: Cluster communication with worker nodes
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create a cluster security group object in Crossplane, and wait until the corresponding
# Security Group in AWS is created and Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "cluster_sg.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
securitygroup.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-cluster-sg created
securitygroup.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-cluster-sg condition met
```

Retrieve the SecurityGroupID for cluster security group:

```bash
CLUSTER_SECURITY_GROUP_ID=$(kubectl get -f "cluster_sg.yaml" -o=jsonpath='{.status.securityGroupID}')
```

### Database Security Group

A [Security Group] is created to later to be assigned to the RDS database
instance. This security group enables the database instance to accept traffic
from the internet in a certain port.

```bash
# build the rds security group yaml
cat > rds_sg.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: network.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: SecurityGroup
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-rds-sg
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  vpcId: ${VPC_ID}
  groupName: ${CONFIG_NAME}-rds-sg
  description: open rds access to crossplane workload
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  ingress:
    - fromPort: 3306
      toPort: 3306
      protocol: tcp
      cidrBlocks:
        - cidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
          description: all ips
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create a security group object for the rds instance in Crossplane
# and wait until the corresponding Security Group in AWS is created and Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "rds_sg.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
securitygroup.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-rds-sg created
securitygroup.network.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-rds-sg condition met
```

Retrieve the SecurityGroupID for rds security group:

```bash
RDS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID=$(kubectl get -f "rds_sg.yaml" -o=jsonpath='{.status.securityGroupID}')
```

### Database Subnet Group

A [Database Subnet Group] creates a group of Subnets which can communicate with
an RDS database instance.

```bash
# build db subnet group yaml
cat > dbsubnetgroup.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: storage.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: DBSubnetGroup
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-dbsubnetgroup
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  groupName: ${CONFIG_NAME}_dbsubnetgroup
  description: EKS vpc to rds
  subnetIds:
    - ${SUBNET1_ID}
    - ${SUBNET2_ID}
    - ${SUBNET3_ID}
  tags:
    - key: name
      value: ${CONFIG_NAME}-dbsubnetgroup
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create db subnet group object in Crossplane, and wait until the corresponding
# DB Subnet Group in AWS is created and Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "dbsubnetgroup.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
dbsubnetgroup.storage.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-dbsubnetgroup created
dbsubnetgroup.storage.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-dbsubnetgroup condition met
```

We need to retrieve the SubndtIDs for subsequent resources:

```bash
RDS_SUBNET_GROUP_NAME=$(kubectl get -f "dbsubnetgroup.yaml" -o=jsonpath='{.spec.groupName}')
```

### Cluster IAM Role

An [IAM Role] gives permissions to the principal that assumes that role. We
Create a role to be assumed by the cluster, which later is granted the required
permissions to talk to required resources in AWS.

```bash
# build vpc yaml
cat > iamrole.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: identity.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: IAMRole
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-eks-cluster-role
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  roleName: ${CONFIG_NAME}-eks-cluster-role
  description: a role that gives a cool power
  assumeRolePolicyDocument: |
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "eks.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create an IAM Role object in Crossplane, and wait until the corresponding
# IAM Role in AWS is created and Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "iamrole.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
iamrole.identity.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-eks-cluster-role created
iamrole.identity.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-eks-cluster-role condition met
```

To retrieve the IAM Role Arn:

```bash
EKS_ROLE_ARN=$(kubectl get -f "iamrole.yaml" -o=jsonpath='{.status.arn}')
```

### Cluster IAM Role Policies

An [IAM Role Policy] grants a role a certain permission. We add two policies to
the Cluster IAM Role that we created above. These policies are needed for the
cluster to communicate with other aws resources.

```bash
# build policies yaml
cat > policies.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: identity.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: IAMRolePolicyAttachment
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-role-servicepolicy
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  roleName: ${CONFIG_NAME}-eks-cluster-role
  policyArn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSServicePolicy
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
---
apiVersion: identity.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: IAMRolePolicyAttachment
metadata:
  name: ${CONFIG_NAME}-role-clusterpolicy
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
spec:
  roleName: ${CONFIG_NAME}-eks-cluster-role
  policyArn: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSClusterPolicy
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
EOF

# create IAM Role Policy objects in Crossplane, and wait until the corresponding
# IAM Role Policies in AWS are created and Ready to use
apply_and_wait_until_ready "policies.yaml"
```

Sample output:

```bash
iamrolepolicyattachment.identity.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-role-servicepolicy created
iamrolepolicyattachment.identity.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-role-clusterpolicy created
iamrolepolicyattachment.identity.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-role-servicepolicy condition met
iamrolepolicyattachment.identity.aws.crossplane.io/aws-network-config-role-clusterpolicy condition met
```

## Configure Provider Resources

Once we have the network configuration set up, we also need to tell Crossplane
how to satisfy WordPress's claims for a database and a Kubernetes cluster, using
AWS resources. The following resource classes allow the EKSCluster and
RDSInstance claims to be satisfied, using the network configuration we created
in the previous step:

```bash
# build resource classes yaml, by using the configured network resources
cat > resource_classes.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: RDSInstanceClass
metadata:
  name: standard-mysql
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
specTemplate:
  class: db.t2.small
  masterUsername: masteruser
  securityGroups:
    - ${RDS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID}
  subnetGroupName: ${RDS_SUBNET_GROUP_NAME}
  size: 20
  engine: mysql
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
---
apiVersion: compute.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
kind: EKSClusterClass
metadata:
  name: standard-cluster
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
specTemplate:
  region: ${AWS_REGION}
  roleARN: ${EKS_ROLE_ARN}
  vpcId: ${VPC_ID}
  subnetIds:
    - ${SUBNET1_ID}
    - ${SUBNET2_ID}
    - ${SUBNET3_ID}
  securityGroupIds:
    - ${CLUSTER_SECURITY_GROUP_ID}
  workerNodes:
    nodeInstanceType: m3.medium
    nodeAutoScalingGroupMinSize: 1
    nodeAutoScalingGroupMaxSize: 1
    nodeGroupName: demo-nodes
    clusterControlPlaneSecurityGroup: ${CLUSTER_SECURITY_GROUP_ID}
  providerRef:
    name: aws-provider
    namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
  reclaimPolicy: Delete
EOF

# apply the resource classes yaml to Crossplane
kubectl apply -f "resource_classes.yaml"
```

So far we have been creating resources in `INFRA_NAMESPACE`, where all resources
are to configure AWS stack with the AWS account, create a network configuration,
and define resources classes that will satisfied the claims. Now, we will create
an app namespace and populate it with resources that are used to let Crossplane
know how to satisfy the claims. Let's call this namespace `app-project1-dev`

```bash
# the namespace that the app resources will be created
APP_NAMESPACE=app-project1-dev
# create the namespace in Crossplane
kubectl create namespace ${APP_NAMESPACE}
```

Now that we have a namespace, we need to tell Crossplane which resource classes
should be used to satisfy our claims in that namespace. We will create [portable
classes][portable-classes-docs] that have have references to the cloud-specific
classes that we created earlier.

For example, `MySQLInstanceClass` is a portable class. It may refer to AWS's
`RDSInstanceClass`, which is a non-portable class.

To read more about portable classes, how they work, and how to use them in
different ways, including by specifying default classes when no reference is
provided, see the [portable classes and claims
documentation][portable-classes-docs].

```bash
cat > portable_classes.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: database.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: MySQLInstanceClass
metadata:
  name: mysql-standard
  namespace: ${APP_NAMESPACE}
classRef:
  kind: RDSInstanceClass
  apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
  name: standard-mysql
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
---
apiVersion: compute.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: KubernetesClusterClass
metadata:
  name: k8s-standard
  namespace: ${APP_NAMESPACE}
classRef:
  kind: EKSClusterClass
  apiVersion: compute.aws.crossplane.io/v1alpha2
  name: standard-cluster
  namespace: ${INFRA_NAMESPACE}
---
EOF

kubectl apply -f "portable_classes.yaml"
```

For more details about resource claims and how they work, see the [documentation
on resource claims][resource-claims-docs].

## Recap

To recap what we've set up now in our environment:

- Our provider account, both on the provider side and on the Crossplane side.
- A Network Configuration for all instances to share.
- An EKSClusterClass and an RDSInstanceClass with the right configuration to use
  the mentioned networking setup.
